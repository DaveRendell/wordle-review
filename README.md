# Wordle Review

This is a script for seeing how many words you had left at each guess in Wordle.

It won't really help you cheat at Wordle, as you need to know the answer for it to work in the first place

## Running the script
```sh
    npm i
    npm start
```

## Finding "best" starting word

Included is another script that figures out what starting word leaves the least possible answers on average.

It takes a fair while to run, so the results are included in `results.json`.

To run it yourself, run `npm run best-guess`
